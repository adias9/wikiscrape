# wikiscrape

Wikiscrape is a tool that allows you to scrape Wikipedia and build connectivity graphs of wikipedia pages given a seed page.  One such example I used is hip hop rappers and their connecting pages measuring the connectivity of each page to find out the most cited rappers in different pages.

Wikiscrape uses Scrapy, a python library, to accomplish this.
